# About The M365X-Lab Project

The idea for this project was to give myself more hands on experience using Intune, Autopilot, EntraID, Defender for Endpoint, and other associated technologies in the Microsoft Azure ecosystem. I enjoy creating standardized setups that simplify IT operations. They can reduce new employee onboarding workload by outsourcing the heavy lifting to Intune and let it manage automatically setting up each employee as specified by their group status.

I want this to be as close to a real life simulation as possible so I had ChatGPT generate some simulation user data in the form of an [uploadable CSV file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbusbee505/IntuneLab/refs/heads/main/busbeecorp_user_import.csv). My Microsoft Entra trial limited me to 25 users so I had it generate 24 users (not including myself). Each user has randomized information and was assigned to a department so I can have different groups apply to each department. Entra can use dynamic rules to assign users to groups based on their user information.

I created a GitHub repo for this project to share files such as my user CSV, config files and other artifacts I generate in the lab. The link to the repo can be found [here](https://github.com/mbusbee505/IntuneLab). Feel free to use what I have here in your own lab setup. If it helps you get up and running faster I've done my job.
