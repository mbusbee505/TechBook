I wanted to test a few commonly used apps that also showcase the different methods of installing apps with Intune. I decided on the following:

- Line-of-business (LOB) - Zoom Workplace
- Win32 App - Google Chrome
- Microsoft Store app - GlobalProtect VPN
- Microsoft 365 Apps for Windows 11 - Microsoft Office

It looks like I will also need to add these to the Enrollment Status Page blocking so the user will not have access to the desktop until these are installed.

# Line-of-business (LOB) - Zoom Workplace

To create a LOB app you basically just need to find the .msi version of the app's installer and load it into Intune. Just go to `Intune > Apps > All apps > Create > App type > Line-of-business app`.

Next it will ask to upload the file you can select it from your computer locally after downloading it from the internet or wherever else.

In my case I went to [Zoom's installer catalog](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0060407), found the `Zoom Workplace desktop app for Meetings (ARM) - MSI installer`, and downloaded it to my computer. I then went back to Intune and selected this file for the upload.

> Keep in mind I only chose ARM due to the VM used for testing. In another environment you would want to consider the architecture and OS requirements for your app/device compatibility.

Luckily for me the Intune LOB App Wizard pre-populated a lot of the information to set up the app including the Name and Description. It labeled it as (ARM64) so if I needed to also provision the AMD64 version it would be easy to tell them apart.

For the Command-line arguments section I added the following:

```
/qn /norestart
```

This will prevent the device from restarting after the Zoom install is complete. 

On the Assignments page I chose the `All-Windows-11` group to receive this install. This is where I could consider separating app availability by group membership but for now I will allow it on all Windows 11 devices.
