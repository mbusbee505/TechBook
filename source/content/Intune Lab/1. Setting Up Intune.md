# Signing Up

First things first, I had to sign up for the [Intune Free Trial](https://aka.ms/IntuneTrial), provided an email address and a few other pieces of info.

The trial allows for 25 users but we get all the same features as the paid version of the environment.

# Nuke The Security Defaults

Next up I needed to turn off the Entra security defaults so theres room for my conditional access policies to take effect without conflict. To do this I went to Entra > Overview > Properties > Manage security defaults and set it to `Disabled (not recommended)`.

When asked for the reason, I selected "My organization plans to use Conditional Access". 

# Uploading Corporate Workforce

Every good organization needs at least a few users, so to make things seem more real I'm going to upload to Entra a [CSV file of simulated User data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbusbee505/IntuneLab/refs/heads/main/busbeecorp_user_import.csv) that makes up my fake company workforce.

To get to the user upload I went to Entra > Users > Bulk Operations > Bulk Create and selected my file in the search field.

If you need a fresh template for new users you can download one provided by Microsoft here as well.

To see that it worked I refreshed the page and went to the All Users section.

# Setting Up Security Groups for Users and Devices

I wanted a way to automate the group creation. I found its possible via a few PowerShell commands.

First make sure you have Microsoft Graph installed.

```
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser
```

Then connect to your tenant:

```
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Group.ReadWrite.All" -TenantID "<Your Tenant ID>"
```

The Tenant ID can be found by going to Entra > Overview

After running this command for the first time like I was, you may have a pop-up browser window asking for permission to connect. Make sure to give it the access so you can continue running commands.

To test that the connection works run 

```
Get-MgContext
```

It should output some info about your Tenant like below. If this doesn't work you will need to check your connect command again and ensure you are using the right Tenant ID.

Once I confirmed connection I ran the command below which added the following security groups to Entra:
- Exec
- HR
- Finance
- IT
- Sales
- Marketing
- Eng
- Support
- All-Devices
- All-iOS
- All-Android

```
$groupNames = @(
    'Exec','HR','Finance','IT','Sales',
    'Marketing','Eng','Support',
    'All-Devices','All-iOS','All-Android'
)
foreach ($name in $groupNames) {
    $params = @{
        DisplayName     = $name
        MailNickname    = ($name -replace '\s','')
        Description     = "$name security group"
        SecurityEnabled = $true
        MailEnabled     = $false
        GroupTypes      = @()
    }
    New-MgGroup @params
}
```

Once I saw the success screen come through successfully I went to Entra > Groups > All Groups and found the groups added via PowerShell.
