# Signing Up

First things first, I had to sign up for the [Intune Free Trial](https://aka.ms/IntuneTrial), provided an email address and a few other pieces of info.

The trial allows for 25 users but we get all the same features as the paid version of the environment.

# Initial Settings Config

Next up I needed to turn off the Entra security defaults so theres room for my conditional access policies to take effect without conflict. To do this I went to Entra > Overview > Properties > Manage security defaults and set it to `Disabled (not recommended)`
