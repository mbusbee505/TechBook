# Signing Up

First things first, I had to sign up for the [Intune Free Trial](https://aka.ms/IntuneTrial), provided an email address and a few other pieces of info.

The trial allows for 25 users but we get all the same features as the paid version of the environment.

# Nuke The Security Defaults

Next up I needed to turn off the Entra security defaults so theres room for my conditional access policies to take effect without conflict. To do this I went to Entra > Overview > Properties > Manage security defaults and set it to `Disabled (not recommended)`.

When asked for the reason, I selected "My organization plans to use Conditional Access". 

# Uploading Corporate Workforce

Every good organization needs at least a few users, so to make things seem more real I'm going to upload to Entra a [CSV file of simulated User data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbusbee505/IntuneLab/refs/heads/main/busbeecorp_user_import.csv) that makes up my fake company workforce.

To get to the user upload I went to Entra > Users > Bulk Operations > Bulk Create and selected my file in the search field.

If you need a fresh template for new users you can download one provided by Microsoft here as well.
