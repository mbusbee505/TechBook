# Introduction to Security

One benefit of managing devices with Intune is that it gives you control of security features across the devices it manages and allows IT admins the ability to fine-tune their environments to meet their security and compliance needs. There are several methods available such as security baselines, defender for endpoint, compliance policies, conditional access, etc. that can be used to our benefit.

Every organization will have different concerns when it comes to data governance, risk, compliance, regulation, and other requirements make demands on how things can be structured. Since there is no one-size-fits-all solution to security, this section is meant as more of a walkthrough of options available within Intune rather than a comprehensive list of air-tight security measures. As always with security, consider your own threat model and how it applies to the resources available. 

# Security Baselines

Conveniently, Microsoft created a way for administrators to change granular security settings that can be saved as templates called Security Baselines. 

To access Security Baselines just go to `Intune > Endpoint security > Security Baselines > Security Baseline for Windows 10 and later > Create policy`. Most of the recommended defaults Microsoft gives us are pretty good so generally it is good enough to keep what is already in there but this would be the place to go for granular changes. 

- **Name**: Windows 11 Baseline
- **Description**: Windows 11 Baseline
- **Configuration Settings**: Keep Defaults
- **Assignments**: All-Employees and All-Windows-11

Once you save this baseline the security settings chosen in Configuration Settings will be enforced on all users and Windows 11 devices. If we wanted to tweak these settings later on we could come back and change the settings or possibly create a new baseline and assign it to a different group of users or devices. 

We could also consider, for testing purposes, limiting the rollout of this Security Baseline to our IT pilot users similar to howe we did with the Update Rings. This way we could ensure the baseline works correctly for non-critical users before pushing it out to all users.

# Defender for Endpoint

Next we can setup Defender for Endpoint to connect with each of our devices in Intune so we can get visibility over the devices security and compliance status. Defender for Endpoint provides comprehensive protection for endpoint devices to guard users and provide better management capabilities for IT admins.

To configure Defender for Endpoint you must first connect it to the Intune environment. In Intune go to `Endpoint security > Microsoft Defender for Endpoint` and set the following setting:

- **Allow Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to enforce Endpoint Security Configurations**: On

This will let Defender control the configurations within the Intune environment. You will next need to go to the Defender portal and connect Defender to Intune on the other side. If this is the first time visiting Defender in your lab you will need to go to `Defender > Trials > Defender Vulnerability Management > Begin trial` so you have access to the portal.

Microsoft warns it can take some time to set up the Defender environment after signing up for the trial so I recommend hitting the button as soon as possible when you start your lab.
