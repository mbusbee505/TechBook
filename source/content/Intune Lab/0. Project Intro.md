The idea for this project was to give myself more hands on experience using Intune, Autopilot, EntraID, and other associated technologies in the Microsoft Azure ecosystem. I want this to be as close to a real life simulation as possible so I had ChatGPT generate some simulation user data in the form of an uploadable CSV file. 

I created a GitHub repo for this project to share files such as my user CSV, config files and other artifacts I generate in the lab. The link to the repo can be found here: https://github.com/mbusbee505/IntuneLab
